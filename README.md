# MiniSocialNetwork
This project is an implementation of a mini social network using php as a server side programming language  by adopting MVC (Model-view-controller) architecture. 
I used Doctrine framework for database interaction and JQuery/Ajax for asynchronous requests. 
Also, Bootstrap 4 is used for the design and application's eronomy.
